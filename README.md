# Experiment---4

Aim -> To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators. <br> 

Theory -> Bitwise Operaotors in C++ are used to perform bit-level operations on the operands. <br> 
          Its symbols and functions are as follows: <br> 
          1. & -> Binary AND <br>
          2. | -> Binary OR <br>
          3. ^ -> Binary XOR <br> 
          4. << -> Left Shift  <br> 
          5. >> -> Right Shift <br> 
          6. ~ -> Compelement <br>

Conclusion -> I learnt about bitwise operators.
